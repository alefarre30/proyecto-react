                        <li>Because it connects us to the land we live on, and to the people who live here.</li>
                        <li>Because itâ€™s more meaningful to cook and eat something made by a person nearby than by some distant corporation.</li>
                        <li>Because good local food makes our corner of the world a better place to live.</li>
                        <li>Because it supports local jobs.</li>
                        <li>Because it makes more sense for the environment.</li>
